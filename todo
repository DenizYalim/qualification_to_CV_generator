tech stack: react, python, openai 

frontend architecture:
* there should be a list asking for qualifications of a person
* and a text box asking for the job's description, and lastly a button that says create!
* the created pdf should start to download

backend architecture:
* User's qualifications should be stored in sqlLite, just text
* model:    qualification = {essential :boolean, """whether this should be always be in the cv""", text : String }
* Idk how to create cv pdf files based of a template





functions:
* make gpt create good header descriptions
* allow qualities that should be displayed always, essentials
* allow portrait support
